1. The Provably Fair Dice Game Logic
This is the underlying game the bot is designed to play. The logic, shown in image (1).webp, ensures that the outcome is deterministic and verifiable, preventing manipulation by the casino or the player.
Key Components:
● Server Seed: A secret random value generated by the game server. Its SHA-256 hash (server_seed_hash) is shown to the player before the bet.
● Client Seed: A random value provided by the player's browser or client. The player can change this value.
● Nonce: A simple incrementing number that represents the bet count for the current seed pair.
Result Generation Process:
1. Combination: A combined_seed is created by concatenating the server_seed, the client_seed, and the current nonce.
2. Hashing: This combined_seed is hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm. The result is a long hexadecimal string.
3. Roll Extraction: The bot iterates through the SHA-512 hash string, taking 5-character chunks.
4. Conversion: Each 5-character hexadecimal chunk is converted into an integer.
5. Modulo Bias Reduction: To ensure a fair distribution, the system checks if the
generated integer is greater than 1,000,000. If it is, that number is discarded, and the next 5-character chunk from the hash is used. This process repeats until a valid number
 
 is found.
6. Final Result: The final game number is calculated using a modulo operation: lucky %
10000. This produces a result between 0 and 9999, which corresponds to a dice roll (e.g., 4923 becomes 49.23).
2. The Machine Learning Prediction Engine
This is the core of the bot's intelligence, as detailed in image.webp. Its purpose is to analyze the history of previous game rounds to predict the outcome of the next one.
Objective:
To predict the next dice roll (an integer from 0-100) and calculate the model's confidence in that prediction.
Feature Engineering & Data Transformation:
The model doesn't just use the raw historical data. It performs a complex transformation to create a feature set (a tensor) that the ML model can understand.
1. Input Data: The engine fetches a history of past rounds from the game site. For each historical round, it uses the following data points:
○ hash: The SHA-512 hash of that round.
○ next_roll & previous_roll: The dice rolls immediately following and preceding that
round.
○ client_seed: The client seed used for that round.
○ nonce: The nonce of that round.
2. Bit-Unpacking: The core transformation technique is bit-unpacking. Each hexadecimal character from the input data is converted into a vector of four binary floating-point numbers.
○ Example: The hex character 'B' is 11 in decimal and 1011 in binary. It would be transformed into a vector [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. This process expands the feature space, allowing the model to find patterns at the bit level.
3. Tensor Construction: The bit-unpacked vectors from all the historical data points are
 
 concatenated into one large vector. This vector is then padded with zeros to a final, fixed size of 2336 elements. This fixed size is required as the input for the neural network.
Model Inference:
1. The final 2336-element vector is converted into a Tensor.
2. This tensor is passed to a pre-trained machine learning model (self.model.forward).
3. The model outputs two values:
○ predicted_output: The model's best guess for the next roll, as an integer (e.g., 52).
○ confidence: A floating-point number representing how certain the model is about its
prediction.
3. The Betting Strategy Module
This component, configured in image (2).webp, acts as the bot's brain. It takes the prediction from the ML engine and decides what action to take.
Configuration:
The strategy is designed to be pluggable and configurable. When the bot starts, a specific strategy (in this case, MyStrat) is initialized with key parameters using a builder pattern:
● .with_balance(0.07747934): Sets the starting bankroll.
● .with_min_bet(...): Sets the minimum allowable bet amount for the currency being used.
● .with_initial_bet(...): Sets the starting bet size for the strategy's logic (e.g., for a
Martingale progression).
Logic (Inferred):
The strategy module receives the predicted_output and confidence from the ML engine. It then uses its internal logic—which could be anything from a simple Martingale system to a
 
complex, stateful algorithm—to make a decision. A likely interface for any strategy would be a method like:
calculate_bet(prediction: u32, confidence: f32, current_balance: f64) -> Option<BetParameters>
Where BetParameters would contain:
● amount: How much to wager.
● condition: Whether to bet 'over' or 'under' the predicted number.
● target: The number to bet against (e.g., bet 'over' 49.5).
If the strategy decides not to bet (e.g., if confidence is too low), it would return None.
4. Overall Application Flow
Putting all the components together, the bot operates in a continuous loop:
1. Initialization: The bot starts, loading the pre-trained ML model and initializing the chosen Betting Strategy with the starting balance and bet settings.
2. Fetch History: The bot connects to the game site API and fetches the most recent game history.
3. Predict: The historical data is fed into the ML Prediction Engine, which processes the data (using bit-unpacking) and returns a predicted_output and a confidence score.
4. Decide: The prediction and confidence are passed to the Betting Strategy Module. The strategy analyzes these inputs, along with its own internal state (current balance, win/loss streak, etc.), and decides whether to place a bet.
5. Execute: If the strategy module returns a valid bet, the bot executes the bet on the game site via its API.
6. Update & Repeat: The bot waits for the game round to complete, updates its balance, and begins the loop again from step 2.
